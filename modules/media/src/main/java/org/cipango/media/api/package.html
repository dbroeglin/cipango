  This API defines objects to manipulate RTP media streams. Using this API,
  media streams can be mixed, played from a file, recorded to a file, etc.
  This API also detects DTMF and invokes callbacks on DTMF detection to define
  the appropriated behavior.

  MediaFactory is the factory that provides all instances of media api objects.
  Thus, the number of objects that can be created by Media factory can be
  configured and if too many objects are requested by api user, media factory
  will throw a NoObjectAvailableException.
</p>
<p>
  MediaFactory also provides an ExecutorService instance and a
  ScheduledExecutorService to run asynchronous tasks. Those tasks can be run
  once using ExecutorService or on a regular basis using
  ScheduledExecutorService.
</p>
<p>
  The media API thread policy can be configured in MediaFactory. Thus, a fixed
  thread pool can be configured in MediaFactory with an arbitrary number of
  threads to limit the number of threads employed by media API.
