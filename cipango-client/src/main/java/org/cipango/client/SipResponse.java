/**
 * Represents SIP responses. Instances of this class are passed to servlets when the container
 * receives incoming SIP responses and also, servlets acting as UA servers or proxies generates SIP
 * responses of their own by creating SipServletResponses. SIP responses has a three-digit status
 * code that indicates the outcome of the corresponding request. Responses with a status code in the
 * range of 100-199 (1xx's) are called provisional or informational and indicate progress in
 * processing of the request. Any response with a status code of 200 or higher is a final response.
 * A UA server may send only one final response per request but this may be preceeded by any number
 * of provisional responses. 2xx responses indicate a successful outcome while 3xx-6xx indicate a
 * variety of non-success conditions. The summary of status codes is [RFC 3261]: 1xx: Informational
 * -- request received, continuing to process the request 2xx: Success -- the action was
 * successfully received, understood, and accepted 3xx: Redirection -- further action needs to be
 * taken in order to complete the request 4xx: Client Error -- the request contains bad syntax or
 * cannot be fulfilled at this server 5xx: Server Error -- the server failed to fulfill an
 * apparently valid request 6xx: Global Failure -- the request cannot be fulfilled at any server
 * Note: Because of a change in Servlet spec 2.4 the setCharacterEncoding() does NOT throw the
 * java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException as derived from
 * SipServletMessage.setCharacterEncoding(String) but inherits a more generic setCharacterEncoding()
 * method from the javax.servlet.ServletResponse.
