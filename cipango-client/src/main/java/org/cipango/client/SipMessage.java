/**
 * Defines common aspects of SIP requests and responses.
 * The Servlet API is defined with an implicit assumption that servlets receives requests from clients, 
 * inspects various aspects of the corresponding ServletRequest object, and generates a response by setting various attributes 
 * of a ServletResponse object. 
 * This model fits HTTP well, because HTTP servlets always execute origin servers; 
 * they execute only to process incoming requests and never initiates HTTP requests of their own.
 * SIP services, on the other hand, does need to be able to initiate requests of their own. 
 * This implies that SIP request and response classes are more symmetric, that is, 
 * requests must be writable as well as readable, and likewise, responses must be readable as well as writable.
 * The SipServletMessage interface defines a number of methods which are common to SipServletRequest and SipServletResponse, 
 * for example setters and getters for message headers and content. 
 * System Headers 
 * 
 * Applications must not add, delete, or modify so-called "system" headers. 
 * These are header fields that the servlet container manages: 
 * From, To, Call-ID, CSeq, Via, Route (except through pushRoute), Record-Route. 
 * Contact is a system header field in messages other than REGISTER requests 
 * and responses, 3xx and 485 responses, and 200/OPTIONS responses. 
 * Additionally, for containers implementing the reliable provisional responses extension, 
 * RAck and RSeq are considered system headers also. Note that From and To are system header 
 * fields only with respect to their tags (i.e., tag parameters on these headers 
 * are not allowed to be modified but modifications are allowed to the other parts).  
 * 
 * Implicit Transaction State 
 * 
 * SipServletMessage objects always implicitly belong to a SIP transaction, 
 * and the transaction state machine (as defined by the SIP specification) constrains what 
 * messages can legally be sent at various points of processing. 
 * If a servlet attempts to send a message which would violate the SIP specification 
 * (for example, the transaction state machine), the container throws an IllegalStateException.
